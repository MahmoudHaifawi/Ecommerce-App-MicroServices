#  /**
#    * Central configuration file for the Spring Cloud Config Server microservice.
#    * <p>
#    * This YAML file defines service registration, property management, and
#    * distributed tracing settings for the config server, allowing seamless integration in
#    * a microservices environment. It plays a critical role in externalizing configurations
#    * for all microservices managed by the config server.
#    * </p>
#    * <b>Key Sections:</b>
#    * <ul>
#    *   <li>
#    *     <b>eureka:</b> <br>
#    *       Registers the config server with Eureka for service discovery.
#    *       <ul>
#    *         <li><code>instance.hostname</code>: Hostname used by Eureka registry.</li>
#    *         <li><code>client.service-url.defaultZone</code>: Eureka registry endpoint.</li>
#    *       </ul>
#    *   </li>
#    *   <li>
#    *     <b>spring.cloud.config.override-system-properties:</b> <br>
#    *       Determines precedence between configuration properties and system properties.
#    *   </li>
#    *   <li>
#    *     <b>management.tracing.sampling.probability:</b> <br>
#    *       Sets the distributed tracing sample rate (1.0 = 100% trace).</li>
#    *   </li>
#    * </ul>
#    * <b>Purpose:</b>
#    * <ul>
#    *   <li>Centralizes configuration management for distributed microservices.</li>
#    *   <li>Facilitates dynamic property updates, environment separation, and service discovery.</li>
#    *   <li>Enables robust observability and diagnostics through tracing.</li>
#    * </ul>
#    * <b>Usage:</b>
#    * <ul>
#    *   <li>Used by the config-server at startup.</li>
#    *   <li>Ensures that all managed microservices can fetch and update their configuration from a central location.</li>
#    * </ul>
